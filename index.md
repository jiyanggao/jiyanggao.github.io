## About Me
I'm Jiyang Gao (高继扬), currently a PhD candidate at University of Southern California, advised by [Prof. Ram Nevatia](http://iris.usc.edu/people/nevatia/). My research focus on computer vision, especially on **temporal perception and reasoning** in videos. I obtained my B.S. degree from Tsinghua University in 2015. I did internship at Sensetime in 2015 and at Google Research during 2017 summer, I will spend 2018 summer at Google Cloud AI.

## Education
**Ph.D in University of Southern California, Aug 2015 - Dec 2018 (expected)**
